Declare a buffer of size 4096

inside main:

Declare int count = 1
Declare size_t size = 1

if (argc == 1) //no arguments supplied
  while size > 0, set size = fread of stdin
   use fwrite to write to stdout

else
  while (count < argc): 
    if strcmp of argv[count] to "-" = 0
      repeat the steps above for if no arguments were supplied
    else
      open file using fopen
      if the file does not exist
        print an error message
      else
        use fread to read the contens into a buffer
        use fwrite to write the buffer's contents to stdout
